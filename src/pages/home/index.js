            <p>
              This website has been created to showcase the work of Chalermkiat
              Jaisuk. Additionally, it has been developed to enhance my skills
              in the field of web development. Through this project, I have
              utilized languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and
              the React framework to further my abilities as a web developer.
